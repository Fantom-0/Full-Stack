    <h1>Ozymandias</h1>

    <h3>by pershy bysshe Shelley</h3>

    <p>I met a traveller from an antique land,<br>
    who said-:two vast and trunkless legs of stone <br>
    Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,<br>
    Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown <br>
    And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, <br>
    Tell that its sculptor well those passions read <br>
    Which yet survivem stamped on these lifeless things, <br>
    The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed; <br>
    And on the pedestal, these words appear: <br>
    My name is <span> Ozymandias</span>, King of kings; <br>
    Look on my Works, ye Mighty , and despair!</p>
